    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[3] Web browsers
    receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
    the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br><br><br>

    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive
    forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
    semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other.<br><br><br>

    The language is written in the form of hTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br><br><br>
